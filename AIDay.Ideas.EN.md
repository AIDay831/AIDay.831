# AIDay Ideas

### The Origin

> Intelligence is endless, and the civilization that human beings pursue together. On August 31st  ,1955, the term “Artificial Intelligence” was presented in a written proposal for an international artificial intelligence conference. The proposal was made by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, Claude Shannon.

> The Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence was held at Dartmouth in August 1956. The Dartmouth Conference became a milestone in the history of Artificial Intelligence, with the term Artificial Intelligence officially presented at academic conferences, and 1956 became the first year of Artificial Intelligence.

> AI will bring human civilization to an unprecedented new height, and human society will therefore face unprecedented new challenges. To Honor the past, Show the present, Explore the future, Combining a wide range of social forces and Collective intelligence to achieve a brilliant era of intelligence in the history of human civilization, We initiated the AIDay.

### What’s AIDay?

### Vision

> Intelligence is endless! To make AIDay a science and technology festival that carries the dreams of Intelligence, humanity and the future.

### Values: From “Human-centered” to “Democratizing AI”

AI should make up for the weakness of human nature rather than take advantage of it, and augment rather than replace human capability;<br/> 
AI respects fundamental rights（including the right of choice）with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security.

### Shared Day, Shared Future

> AIDay is not only the festival of global  AI practitioners, but also a shared day of “all of us” and “AI species”; not only to promote AI technology, products and services, but also explore the relationship between people and “AI species”, to Co-build a balanced and trustworthy AI-powered world.
